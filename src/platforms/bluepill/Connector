The connector used for debug is the 0.1" header to the West side of the board with the USB
connector pointing North. You can get a pinout from;

My pinning and colours are;

Pin number    Name        Colour   Purpose
from bottom
   1          3v3	  White    3v3 Feed
   2          Gnd      !* Black    Ground Connection
   3          5v          Brown    5V USB Derrived Feed
   4          PB9      !* Purple   TMS  / SWDIO
   5          PB8      !* Grey     TCK  / SWCLK
   6          PB7       * Green    TDO   / SWO
   7          PB6       * Yellow   TDI  
   8          PB5         Orange   nSRST
   9          PB4         Blue     VSense (Target voltage present)

For a minimal SWD interface the connections marked (!) are needed. For a minimal JTAG interface
the ones marked (*) are needed. Since the debugger only runs at 3v3 the VSense is not
needed for operation, but bear in mind that providing voltage through port connections to
an unpowered CPU is eventually going to cause trouble with latch-up and similar....so in 
general make sure your target is powered, or interface to it via 47R resistors or larger.

I have successfully connected with both JTAG and SWD.
