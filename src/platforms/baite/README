This adapts the Black Magic firmware for the ST-Link v2 clone from Baite (betemcu.cn).
It is based on a STM32F103C8.

connector
=========

Black Magic Probe (Baite) pinout:
     _____
SRST |1 2| +3.3V
 +5V |3 4| JTCK/SWCLK
  RX  5 6| JTMS/SWDIO
 GND |7 8| JTDO/TRACESWO
  TX |910| JTDI
     -----

flashing
========

Program the adapter using the UART port on the back through the serial bootloader.

UART port:
1 RX (square)
2 TX
3 BOOT0 (set high when powering the board to start the serial bootloader)
4 +5V
5 GND

Disable flash read/write protection to be able to write firmware.

notes
=====

All connector pins have 220 ohms inline protection resistors.
RX is pulled high using a 620 ohms resistor, thus the TX on the target board needs to pull low strong enough to successfully transmit data.
PB6/PB7 (UART1) are remapped in the firmware to provide TX/RX.
TRACESWO (TIM3_CH1) should be supported but has not been tested.

Since this adapter is based on an STM32F103C8 micro-controller with 64 kB of flash the DFU bootloader only advertises 56 kB of flash available for the main application (through a DFuSe name visible using dfu-util -l).
STM32F103C8 micro-controllers often have 128 kB of flash though, despite what the datasheet or the internal flash size register advertise.
Because the blackmagic firmware exceeds the 56 kB size it will not be possible to flash it through DFU if the DFU software doesn't ignore this restriction.
dfu-util complies to the advertised size, but the blackmagic stm32_mem.py script does not, allowing to flash the main binary using DFU.
Alternatively is also possible to flash the blackmagic firmware using the serial bootloader (at address 0x08002000, and enable verification when flashing to ensure the whole firmware has been written successfully).
