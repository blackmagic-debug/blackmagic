# Common code for the Black Magic Probe Firmware for WeAct Studio F401CC/F401CE/F411CE boards

This code allows using a [Black Pill F4](https://github.com/WeActStudio/WeActStudio.MiniSTM32F4x1) as a Black Magic Probe.

This directory contains the common code for the following platforms:
- [blackpill-f401cc](./../../blackpill-f401cc/README.md)
- [blackpill-f401ce](./../../blackpill-f401ce/README.md)
- [blackpill-f411ce](./../../blackpill-f411ce/README.md)

## How to Build

In the following commands replace `blackpill-f4x1cx` with the platform you are using, e.g. `blackpill-f401cc`.

To build the code using the default pinout, run:

```sh
meson setup build --cross-file=cross-file/blackpill-f4x1cx.ini
meson compile -C build
```

or, to use alternative pinout 1, run:

```sh
meson setup build --cross-file=cross-file/blackpill-f4x1cx.ini -Dalternative_pinout=1
meson compile -C build
```

TODO: No easy way ATM of configuring this on the meson buildsystem.

or, if you are using a PCB (printed circuit board) as a shield for your Black Pill F4, run:

```sh
cd blackmagic
make clean
make PROBE_HOST=blackpill-f4x1cx SHIELD=1
```

## Firmware upgrade with dfu-util

- Install [dfu-util](https://dfu-util.sourceforge.net).
- Connect the Black Pill to the computer via USB. Make sure it is a data cable, not a charging cable.
- Force the F4 into system bootloader mode:
  - Push NRST and BOOT0
  - Wait a moment
  - Release NRST
  - Wait a moment
  - Release BOOT0
- Upload the firmware:
```
./dfu-util -a 0 --dfuse-address 0x08000000:leave -R -D blackmagic.bin
```
- Exit dfu mode: press and release nRST. The newly flashed Black Magic Probe should boot and enumerate.

For other firmware upgrade instructions see the [Firmware Upgrade](https://black-magic.org/upgrade.html) section.

## SWD/JTAG frequency setting

In special cases the SWD/JTAG frequency needs to be adapted. The frequency can be set to `900k`, as this value was found to be helpful in practice, using:

```
mon freq 900k
```

For details see the [pull request](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic/pull/783#issue-529197718) that implemented the `mon freq` command.
