 * The basic idea is that SWO comes in on a pin connected to a timer block,
 * and because Manchester coding is self-clocking we can determine the timing
 * for that input signal when it's active, so: use the timer to capture edge
 * transition timings; fire an interrupt each complete cycle; and then use some
 * timing analysis on the CPU to extract the SWO data sequence.
 *
 * We use the first capture channel of a pair to capture the cycle time and
 * thee second to capture the high time (mark period).
