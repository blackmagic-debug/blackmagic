* STM8S Discovery

The board is a ST-Link V1 Board, but with access to JTAG pins accessible
on CN5. This allows easy reprogramming and reuse of the JTAG header.
Programmatical it seems indistinguishable from a e.g. STM32VL
Discovery. So here a variant that uses CN5 for JTAG/SWD and CN7 for
UART.

Force Bootloader entry is done with shorting CN7 Pin3/4 so PB6 read low while
pulled up momentary by PB6.

Reuse SWIM Pins for Uart (USART1)
RX: CN7 Pin2 ->SWIM_IN (PB7)/USART1_RX / SWIM_IN(PB9)
TX: CN7 Pin4 -> SWIM_RST_IN(PB6)/USART1_TX

* STM32F103 Minimum System Development Board (aka Blue Pill)

This board has the SWD pins of the onboard F103 accessible on one side.
Reuse these pins. There are also jumpers for BOOT0 and BOOT1(PB2). Reuse
Boot1 as "Force Bootloader entry" jumpered high when connecting to USB. Boot1
has 100 k Ohm between MCU and header pin and can not be used as SRST.

All other port pins are have header access with headers not yet soldered.
JTAG TDO: PB3
JTAG TDI: PA15
SWD  SWO: PA10 (use Uart pin as on normal STLINK)

Distinguish boards by checking the SWIM_IN connection PB9/PB10
