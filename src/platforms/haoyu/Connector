The connector appears to be a standard ARM JTAG 20 way connector but chances are there has been more than
one build state so, if in doubt, buzz it out. 

Pin 1 is marked with a white triangle on the top side of the board,  as follows;

1 - Sense (Only connects to the Red Led...but at least tells you the target has power)  [Red]
3 - nTRST 
5 - TDI          [Yellow]
7 -TMS / SWDIO   [Purple]
9 - TCK / SWCLK  [Grey]
11 - N.C.     
13 - TDO / SWO   [Green]
15 - nSRST       [Orange]
17 - N.C.
19 - N.C.

2 - N.C.
4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20 Gnd [Black]

I normally use [White] for voltage feed (3v3 or whatever).

I have successfully connected with both JTAG and SWO.

The 4-pin header you will need to initially program the board;

1 - 3v3  (Nearest 20 pin connector)
2 - SWDIO
3 - SWCLK
4 - Gnd
