System vs BMP Bootloader
========================
For the BMP bootloader, flashing was not reliable. So we use the system
bootloder unconditional.

Connections:
====================

PA0: User button to force system bootloader entry with reset
PA2/PA3 eventual connected to the STLINK/ STM32F103C8

PC2: TDI
PC4: TMS/SWDIO
PC5: TCK/SWCLK
PC6: TDO/TRACESWO

PC1: TRST
PC8: SRST

PD15/Blue Led: Indicator that system bootloader is entered via BMP

Bootstrapping the F4Discovery on-board ST-Link
==============================================
http://embdev.net/articles/STM_Discovery_as_Black_Magic_Probe has some hints
how to modify the F4Discovery on-board ST-Link.  If you try to do so and hit
a problem that stands some test like that you load the right firmware to the
right device via the right BMP probe, explain, report and ask on the
blackmagic mailing list http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=407419.
