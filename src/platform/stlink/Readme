Differences between V1/V2

                V1                V2
ID Pins PC13/14 unconnected       PC 13 pulled low
LED STLINK      PA8, active High  PA9, Dual Led
MCO Out         NA                PA8
RESET(Target)   T_JRST(PB1)       NRST (PB0)

On the NucleoXXXP boards, e.g. NUCLEO-L4R5ZI (144 pin) or
NUCLEO-L452RE-P (64 pins), by default nRst is not connected. To reach the
target nRST pin with the "mon connect_reset enable" option, the right NRST
jumper must be placed. On Nucleo144-P boards it is JP3, on NUCLEO64-P
boards it is JP4.
