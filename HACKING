========================================
The Black Magic Debug Project -- HACKING
========================================

The Black Magic Probe consists of both hardware and firmware components.
The hardware design resides in the 'hardware' directory and the firmware
resides in the 'src' directory.


Compiling for the native hardware
---------------------------------
Run
git submodule init
git submodule update
after cloning blackmagic to fill the libopencm3 directory.

To build the firmware for the standard hardware platform run 'make' in the
src directory.  You will require a GCC cross compiler for ARM Cortex-M3 
targets.  You will also need to have the libopenstm32 library installed.
The default makefile assumes the target is arm-cortexm3-eabi, but 
you can override this on the command line:

make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-

This will result in binary files:
blackmagic - ELF binary of the Black Magic debug probe.
blackmagic.bin - Flat binary of the Black Magic debug probe, load at 0x8002000.
blackmagic_dfu - ELF binary of the Black Magic DFU bootloader.
blackmagic_dfu.bin - Flat binary of the DFU bootloader, load at 0x8000000.

If you already have a JTAG/SWD debug probe that can be used to load these
binaries to your target hardware.  If not the SystemMemory bootloader can
be used to load the DFU bootloader:
../scripts/bootprog.py blackmagic_dfu.bin

This requires an appropriate cable to connect the PC serial port to the probe.
See the schematic for more information.

Once the DFU bootloader is loaded, the Black Magic application can be loaded
over USB:
(First connect the probe and observe the flashing red led)
../scripts/stm32_mem.py blackmagic.bin

The device should reset and re-enumerate as a CDC-ACM device implementing
the GDB protocol.

Errors when compiling libopencm3
-------------------------------
If while compiling libopencm3 you get an error like
arm-none-eabi/bin/ld: error: cdcacm.elf uses VFP register arguments, \
 arm-none-eabi/lib/thumb/v7m/libc.a(lib_a-memcpy-stub.o) does not
your toolchain and libopencm3 disagree on the calling convention for floation
point functions on the F4. Change in
lib/stm32/f4/Makefile and examples/stm32/f4/Makefile.include all apperance of
-mfloat-abi=hard to -mfloat-abi=soft
This doesn't matter for blackmagic, as it doesn't use floating point.

Compiling as a Linux application using FT2232 hardware
------------------------------------------------------
The Black Magic application can also be compiled as a native PC application
which will use an FT2232 device to implement the physical JTAG interface.
This is not the intended mode of operation, but is useful for debugging,
experimentation, and if you don't have the actual hardware.

First, get the VID/PID for your FT2232 device using 'lsusb'.  Edit the file
'src/libftdi/platform.h' and change the VID/PID to match your hardware. 
Compile the application with the command:

make PROBE_HOST=libftdi

Running the application 'blackmagic' will start a GDB server on TCP port 2000.
