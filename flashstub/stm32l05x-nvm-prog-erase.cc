   DESCRIPTION
   -----------

   NVM program flash erase stub for STM32L05x, a Cortex-M0+ core.  The
   stub uses SRAM to host the code fragment to perform the erase.

   This stub should work with the STM32L1xx as well as long as the
   page_size is set appropriately.  The L0's use a page size of 128
   bytes.  The L1's use a page size of 256 bytes.

   If you plan to modify this routine and emit a new stub, make sure
   to audit the code.  We don't have a stack so we cannot make calls
   that save the link pointer.  IOW, the inline functions should be be
   inlined.

   *** FIXME: clear errors before starting.
