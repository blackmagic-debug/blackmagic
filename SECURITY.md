## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've found a vulnerability and wish to responsibly disclose it, please send an email
to disclosure@black-magic.org with a clear description of the issue and steps for how to reproduce
it in the body.

If we can reproduce the issue we will create a fix branch on the main repository with nondescript
commit messages as to the underlying issue and take the fix through our normal pull request process.
For severe issues we may instead use the private mirror of the repository for fixing the bug so we
can publish a fix and release binaries only once ready.

Severe security issues may result in out of band point releases being made to address the problem,
even to otherwise unsupported versions. This will be done at the discretion of the project.

During the process, you will be kept apprised of our progress by email with public disclosure on the
issue tracker or as a PR only once the fix is developed and ready.
