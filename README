The Black Magic Debug Project -- README
=======================================

The Black Magic Debug Probe is gadget providing an in-application
debug capability for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.  It interfaces
with the GDB, the GNU source level debugger over the USB bus, and
communicates with the target microcontroller over either a JTAG or
Serial Wire debug port.

Currently supported microcontrollers:

 - ST STM32 Family
 - TI/LMI Stellaris Family
 - NXP LPC11xx Family
 - Atmel SAM3X


Getting started
===============
The Black Magic Probe is available as a built-up product form Black
Sphere Technologies.  Contact <sales@blacksphere.co.nz> should
you wish to order one.  If you would like to work on the project see
the file HACKING for developer's info.

When connected via USB, the Black Magic probe will enumerate as a CDC-ACM
device which the OS should present as a tty device or serial port.  The
GDB remote debugging protocol is implemented over this virtual character
stream.  To connect your ARM GDB to the target device use the following
commands:

(gdb) target extended-remote /dev/ttyACM0
(gdb) mon jtag_scan
(gdb) attach 1

The command 'mon swdp_scan' may be used to use the Serial-Wire Debug Protocol
instead of JTAG to connect to the target.

Once attached, all the standard GDB commands may be used to start and control
the execution of the embedded application.

The peripheral registers are not included in the memory map provided to GDB.
I suggest you add the command "set mem inaccessible-by-default off' to
your '.gdbinit'.  That will allow you to access addresses outside of
the memory map.  It will treat anything outside of the memory map as
RAM.

Semihosting support
===================
Basic armv6m/armv7m semihosting is supported, i.e. you can build your
application in a special way to use host's stdin and stdout right
inside gdb simply by calling printf(), scanf() and other input-output
functions. To make use of it, add --specs=rdimon.specs and -lrdimon to
the linker flags for your firmware.

All writes are treated as writes to the stdout, all reads are done
from stdin; SYS_ISTTY always returns true, SYS_ERRNO -- EINTR;
SYS_OPEN and SYS_FLEN return dummy non-zero values.
